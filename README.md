## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
  [Given more time, I would add more pages to my website to provide in-depth information about my projects. Additionally, I would like to create a gallery section for my artwork. One challenge I anticipate with this is ensuring that the gallery transitions smoothly and gracefully across different aspect ratios. To enhance the user's experience, I would like to add more interactivity through the use of buttons or images that animate or change when scrolled over. However, implementing this feature could be challenging, particularly in synchronizing the user's scrolling with the image sequence to create a seamless and fluid animation. Finally, I would like to include a high contrast mode for users with vision impairments, although a challenge would be changing all the images and website colors at once with one button press.]
* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?
  [ Web accessibility is vital because websites exist to provide access to stores, resources, knowledge, and entertainment for everyone, regardless of their abilities. Making sure websites are easy to use, navigate, and control for all types of users is essential to creating a successful website. To ensure accessibility, I added alt text to all images and transcriptions to videos, implemented easy to use navigation buttons with clear names, and used a high contrast black and white color scheme with a small amount of color for aesthetics. I also made clickable items easily identifiable by either changing their color or size. Lastly, I used left-to-right formatting for any paragraphs longer than a sentence to improve readability.]
